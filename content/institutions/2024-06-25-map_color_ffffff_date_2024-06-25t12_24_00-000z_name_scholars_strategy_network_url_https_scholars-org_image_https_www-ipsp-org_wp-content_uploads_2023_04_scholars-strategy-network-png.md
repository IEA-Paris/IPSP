The Scholars Strategy Network (SSN) is a national membership organization made up of college- and university-based researchers interested in improving policy and strengthening democracy. Founded in 2011 by Theda Skocpol, Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology at Harvard University, SSN has grown into a network of over 1800 researchers in 47 states. SSN members organize themselves into local chapters across the United States, working to advance the use of research wherever policy decisions are made - from city halls to state legislatures to Washington.
