Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) is a global research-action-policy network whose mission is to improve the status of the working poor, particularly women, in the informal economy (waste pickers, street vendors, homeworkers and domestic workers). WIEGO's members include membership-based organizations of workers in the informal economy, researchers and development professionals.
