The SDSN (Sustainable Development Solutions Network) is a non-profit organization working under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General to mobilize the worldâ€™s universities, think tanks, and national laboratories for action on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ; empower societies through free online education; and translate scientific evidence and ideas into solutions and accountability. The SDSN operates at the intersection between science, policy, and development practice to maximize SDG achievements at the global, regional, national, and local levels.
