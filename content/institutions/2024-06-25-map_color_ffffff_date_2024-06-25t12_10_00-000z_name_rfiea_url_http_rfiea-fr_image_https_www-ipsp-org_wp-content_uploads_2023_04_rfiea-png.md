The RFIEA (*Réseau Français des Instituts d'Études Avancées*, French Network of Institutes of Advanced studies) is a french foundation aiming at contributing to the visibility of human and social sciences in France. Its approach is based on a dynamic balance between subsidiarity and pooling, enabling it to generate synergies and undertake large-scale initiatives. It is developing a database of the 1,120+ researchers who have been invited to the institutes, in order to capitalize on the knowledge and international expertise they contribute.
