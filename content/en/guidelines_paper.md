Authors **who participated in IPSP21** will be given the option to publish research notes (WIP track) or full papers (Paper track) in official conference proceedings with an ISSN, and full papers will undergo peer-review. In keeping with the interactive spirit of the conference, the reviewing process for publications will take place after the conference to allow authors to incorporate feedback from their presentations into the final version of their note or paper. The reviewing process will also be community-based, and we encourage you to volunteer and engage as much as possible.

- Research notes should use the [IPSP note template](/conference/IPSP_Research_Note_Template.docx) and be no longer than 2 pages excluding references. Full papers should use the [IPSP paper template](/conference/IPSP21_Full_Paper_Template.docx) and be no longer than 8 pages excluding references.

- Notes and Papers must be submitted by the **21th of January, 2022, 23:59 AoE**.

- Full papers will undergo a semi-anonymized peer-review process. Submitted papers should be anonymized and all identifying information, affiliations and grant numbers should be removed from the document. Please do not remove references to your own work, so reviewers can ensure that all relevant previous research has been taken into account. Instead, refer to your work in the third person, e.g. instead of writing "As we have discussed in (Author et al., 2020)..." use "As discussed by (Author et al., 2020)...".

- Authors submitting a full paper will be required to review at least [two other submissions](/conference/review_guidance).

- Reviewers will be required to provide their feedback by the 13th of February 2022. [Click here](/conference/review_guidance) for guidance on the reviewing process for IPSP21

- Authors are encouraged to incorporate the changes suggested by reviewers into their paper, and to provide a response to the reviews. Published papers will include comments made by reviewers and responses by authors.

Final papers are due on the 4th of **March 2022, 23:59 AoE**.
