**Purpose of Review:**

TheSocioscope21 is embarking on a journey towards a new process for expert feedback and quality assurance in research through peer-review. With the amount of papers submitted to journals and conferences steadily increasing, the workload associated with the traditional format of peer-review has many editors and reviewers struggling. TheSocioscope21 will therefore use a community-based review process, where contributing authors also have to share their expertise in the field to provide feedback on the work of others.

For each submission made to TheSocioscope21 the author (team) will have to review at least two other papers to be included in the publication of the proceedings. If a submission has multiple authors, reviews can be split amongst contributors as preferred, as long as a minimum of two reviews are submitted. Reviews will be public to ensure quality and transparency.

Reviews at TheSocioscope21 do not follow the traditional accept/reject format and will consist of **two parts**. Reviewers are asked to provide a list of comments and suggested improvements the authors could make, and a general assessment and commentary on the paper (see below).

Authors will then have the opportunity to revise their submissions and provide a response to reviewers. The final paper will be published together with the original reviews. Reviews will not be anonymous, allowing reviewers to be part of the conversation around papers, and to receive credit for their reviewing activities, as well as to ensure the respectful and communal spirit of TheSocioscope.

Papers must not be longer than 8 pages using the <a target="_blank" href="/conference/TheSocioscope21_Full_Paper_Template.docx">paper template</a>, but may be shorter. Please consider in your review that the contribution of a shorter, more focused paper is different from a longer one.

**Main points for review:**

- The primary criterion for judging a submission for TheSocioscope21 is: Does this paper make a contribution to our understanding of the societal challenges of sustainable development? A contribution can take many different shapes; it could be empirical, methodological, conceptual, etc.

- Reviews will form an integral part of the paper; writing clearly, coherently and in good form in the review is just as important as in the paper. Very short reviews can be frustrating for authors as they do not help them to improve their work. A high-quality review usually is between one and one and a half pages of text. The easiest way to make sure you produce a helpful review is imagining what level of feedback you would like to see yourself for your work.

- The list of detailed questions, comments, and suggestions for the authors that address specific issues reviewers find with a paper should use <a target="_blank" href="https://thesocioscope.org/conference/TheSocioscope21_Review_Template.docx">this template</a> and will NOT be included in the final publication. Potential items on the list include but are not limited to: Spelling errors, mathematical errors, suggestions for revising the structure of the paper, asking for more detail on an argument or the description of the data collection process, further literature to be considered.

- The commentary should be provided as a coherent text and discuss relevance, content, and the general contribution of the paper as well as potential shortcomings if applicable. It may also look out into the future and suggest further steps to be taken, or ways for implementation of the findings. Reviewer comments will be included in the final publication in the dedicated sections in the paper template.
