## WHEN?

The conference will take place fully remotely as a flip-conference on the 9th & 10th of December 2021\. It will offer both light-touch (WIP track) and peer-reviewed (Paper track) outlets for any type of work in progress and research that is related to the challenges of sustainable development.

During the conference, presenters will discuss their research projects with the audience based on their video presentations in live Q&A sessions. Some projects will also be given the opportunity to be highlighted in high-profile, moderated panel discussions in dedicated plenary time slots.
