Contributors are asked to provide a synthetic account of what they are doing and what is the added value of their initiative. The abstract should be informative and self-explanatory, very explicit about the problem addressed, the innovative dimension and the impact of it. A link can be provided to a webpage containing a more detailed description and material. Providing this material on the platform should not take more than 30-45 minutes.
