title: Who are the referents and how are they chosen?
---

IPSP referents are senior scientists with vast experience; they operate *pro bono*for the benefit of the community. A [list of referents](https://IP4SP.org/referent_list) is published on IPSP website. The International [Scientific Advisory board](https://IP4SP.org/advisory_board) validates admission to IPSP communities of referents.
