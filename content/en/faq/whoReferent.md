TheSocioscope.org referents are senior scientists with vast experience; they operate *pro bono*for the benefit of the community. A [list of referents](https://TheSocioscope.org/referent_list) is published on TheSocioscope.org website. The International [Scientific Advisory board](https://TheSocioscope.org/advisory_board) validates admission to TheSocioscope.org communities of referents.
