First, thank you very much for your support!

If you would like to promote IPSP as an initiative, you can use our social networks by following us on our [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/international-panel-on-social-progress-ipsp)page. You can also use our [website ](https://www.ipsp.org/)resources and contact the [pressroom](https://IP4SP.org/press_room).

If you want to promote a particular project of IPSP, you can use the social share widgets of the share button <v-avatar color="primary" size="24"><v-icon dark small> mdi-share-variant </v-icon> </v-avatar>. The short IPSP URL with IPSP-ID number of your project is also handy as an email footer.

On every IPSP project page. If you plan to share a project with a large audience, we advise you to give a heads up to the project contact using the "Email this project contact" button of the related project page.
