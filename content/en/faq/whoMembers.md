IPSP is an edited global directory of initiatives that functions as an online platform open for all to browse: civil society actors, researchers, funders, governments, media, and the general public alike.

We have three type of contributors:

* **Project leaders** who register their initiative on the platform, update it, receive alerts and offers for collaboration and funding.  
* **Referents** who are aware of new initiatives in their field, screen them, flag those they consider most innovative and inspiring.  
* **Partner institutions** that request their members to register initiatives, publish calls and fund projects, and propose experts as referents.
