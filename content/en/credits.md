TheSocioscope.org is a collective effort to promote scientific collaboration and knowledge advancement. It was originated by [Paris IAS](https://www.paris-iea.fr) and the [RFIEA Foundation](http://rfiea.fr/en).

TheSocioscope.org thanks all those whose contribution and collective intelligence provide us all with this shared resource. Special thanks to Sophie de Bonis, IBM's design lead for the UX advice.

This is a non-profit public-funded initiative.

We welcome donations to build a non-rival scientific public good. If you are interested, please contact: [donations@TheSocioscope.org](mailto:donations@TheSocioscope.org).

This website and logo, as well as its infrastructure, have been designed by [Antoine Cordelois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-cordelois/?locale=en_US). The frontend is static/lambda-generated and is powered by [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Vuetify](http://vuetifyjs.com) .

The backend is built around a serverless/FAAS graphQL API made on top of [AWS ecosystem](https://aws.amazon.com/) and deployed using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

The logo is based on an SVG file downloaded from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Heart-hand-shake.svg) and designed by Ravi Poovaiah, Professor, IDC, IIT Bombay.
