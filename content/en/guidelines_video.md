title: Guidance for video presentations
---

The following formal and technical requirements apply to all video presentations submitted to the conference, and videos that do not adhere to these guidelines **will not be included in the conference**.

It is your responsibility to make sure the video presentation meets those requirements.

- Please use this [presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15_C0LCrs0nIXNN7h-TbgU92S55vcGd8i8FBiGgsJYGk/edit?usp=sharing) for your slides. Presentations should be a maximum of 5 minutes long and uploaded as public videos on YouTube.

- Videos should display the front slide from the template, including the title of the presentation, all authors and their affiliations, and the project's TheSocioscope-ID. Please leave sufficient time for viewers to read the information on the title slide before you proceed with your presentation (at least 5 seconds).

- We strongly encourage you to provide speaker-video in the suggested area on the slides. Please also consider providing closed captions for your video to make your presentation more accessible.

- Make sure that you have the rights and permissions to use all the material that is contained in your submission, including images, music, and video. The obligation to obtain the correct permissions rests with the author, not with TheSocioscope.
